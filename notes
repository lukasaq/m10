Introduction to Switching ###############
Switches operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model,

Traversal between networks is handled on Layer 3 of the OSI model,

Layer 2 of the OSI model — the Data Link layer — handles addressing ethernet frames to direct communication between hosts on the same Local Area Network (LAN). Ethernet frames include Layer 2 addressing with vendor-assigned unique source and destination addresses for segments. In addition, ethernet commonly uses MAC addresses for communication on a segment. Other Layer 2 protocols — such as Frame Relay — use a completely different method of Layer 2 addressing.

MAC addresses are unique 48-bit addresses, separated into six octets, and noted in hexadecimal format. The first three octets — known as the Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) 

Layer 2 Devices ##################
simplest Layer 2 device for ethernet networks that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other is the hub. These devices broadcast all received data frames to all ports, regardless of the intended recipient. While these simple devices may still be found in some older networks, their usage is discouraged due to issues that they present including:
- The broadcast behavior allows any connected device to view traffic bound for any other device on the hub.

- Due to the rebroadcast nature of this device, transmitted frames can often collide when two connected devices attempt to send at the same time — especially during high-traffic load — causing dropped frames or retransmissions.


HUBS: one brodcast domain and one collison domain


switches allow for connectivity between devices; however, unlike hubs, switches utilize logic to determine which ports to forward frames onto. Switching logic and MAC address tables are covered later in this lesson.

Basic switches exist that perform only the bare minimum of switching to ensure that collisions do not occur frequently and ensure basic addressing. These switches — sometimes referred to as unmanaged switches — can be found in small business and home networks and even see use in enterprise networks. However, managed switches are typically utilized in enterprise networks, especially for central connectivity within the network. These switches are able to be configured and support more features — such as the ability to mirror ports, create VLANs to segregate networks, etc.

Cisco Devices ###################

Cisco devices tend to have several different methods for an administrator to connect to them. The most common methods follow:
 
- Direct connection to the console via the console or Auxiliary (AUX) port. This is generally a serial port connection and often requires the included Registered Jack (RJ)-45 to Recommended Standard (RS)-232 cable to connect to. The screen command or a terminal emulator can be used on Linux, while PuTTY or other terminal connection software is common on Windows.

- Connection to a virtual console, typically via Secure Shell (SSH) or Teletype Network (Telnet). Telnet is generally discouraged because its traffic is transmitted in plaintext. Binaries for SSH are available or commonly included on Linux systems and modern builds of Windows — though, PuTTY is still commonly used on Windows.

- Many modern Cisco devices also include web interfaces for viewing the status of and managing the device. These interfaces can be interacted with using standard browsers.


Cisco Security Model ############# 



Privilege level 0 is the lowest level privilege defined by default on Cisco devices. When connected with privilege level 0, the connected user only has access to these commands:
disable: Lower privilege level
enable: Raise privilege level
exit: Close the current session
help: Interact with the help system
logout: Close the current session


User
Privilege level 1. At this level — in addition to the above commands — some additional utilities are available for troubleshooting connectivity, such as the traceroute and ping commands. In addition, some configurations can be viewed via show commands. No configuration changes can be made at this level.


Privileged
Privilege level 15 is the highest level defined by default on Cisco devices. At this privilege level, all commands are available, and the device can be configured.

Cisco Configuration Mode ###########
make changes to the current configuration of the device, the configure terminal command must be used. For this command to be used, the current privilege level must be 15 (Privileged). As the configuration is navigated, the prompt changes to indicate what is currently being configured:

This section covers the version of the device, as well as some services that are configured:

- version: Indicates the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) version for this device
- service timestamps: Determines how timestamps for debug and log entries are displayed
- service password-encryption: Automatically encrypts passwords when a new password is saved; no variant of the command means this is disabled
- service compress-config: Configuration is compressed automatically by this service

hostname: Sets the hostname for this device; shown in the command-line by default, may also be discovered by this name, or respond with this name during network discovery
aaa new-model: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA); disabled, this device does not support AAA features, such as user accounts, user levels, or command-level logging as handled by the AAA feature
spanning-tree mode: Determines the method used for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP
vlan internal allocation policy: Specific VLANs reserved for internal use — determines where these VLANs begin enumerating (ascending starts at VLAN Identifier [ID] 1006 and up, descending at 4095 and below)
interface: GigabitEthernet1/3 here indicates that this device is detected as a gigabit ethernet interface (as opposed to FastEthernet for 100 megabit ethernet) in slot zero, port zero; each internal slot may or may not contain multiple ports, depending on the interface card
media-type: RJ-45, Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP), or Auto
shutdown: Port is administratively disabled, ensuring that the port is not usable
line vty: Five (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) virtual terminals (used for SSH or Telnet) are enabled. Unlike con and AUX ports, these are not physical.


VLANs are defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard, which states that 32 bits are allocated in the ethernet packet header for the following fields:
Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID): 16-bit field set to 0x8100 to identify the 802.1Q packetPriority Code Point (PCP): 3-bit Class of Service (CoS) field; assigned to Layer 2 QoS between switchesDrop Eligible Indicator (DEI): 1-bit field indicating whether the packet can be dropped when insufficient bandwidth is available on a link; when identified, indicates the potential use of Voice over IP (VoIP) trafficVLAN ID: 12-bit field specifying the VLAN associated with a network packet


LAN traversal happens via routing on Layer 3 — so-called Layer 3 switches are able to control and allow machines on different VLANs to communicate with each other in a manner managed by the switch.

Private VLANs further subdivide VLANs, allowing for isolation of devices within a VLAN from each other. When assigning a private VLAN to a port, in addition to the primary VLAN, a community VLAN ID is required. Three types of private VLAN ports exist:

Promiscuous Typically reserved for routers or other gateway devices, these ports can receive traffic from any of the ports in a VLAN, regardless of the private VLAN configurations of those devices.

Isolated Only able to communicate with promiscuous ports, these ports are isolated from all other ports. However, communication with the primary VLAN is possible.

Community Able to communicate with promiscuous ports and other community ports on the same community VLAN. Additionally, community ports can communicate with the primary VLAN.

The default native VLAN for most switch vendors is VLAN 1.


Practical Implications #############
Switch configurations have practical implications for the security of a network. Some examples of attacks that rely on the behavior of switches or misconfigurations follow:

MAC Flooding This attack relies on switches having a limited amount of memory for storing the MAC address table, which is used to store MAC address-to-port associations. Due to the inability to store updates to this table, many switches failover to broadcast mode for all data frames — similar to network hubs. This allows an attacker physically attached to a switch to view all traffic passing through the switch, rather than just traffic intended to be bound for that machine.

MAC Spoofing This attack merely has the attacker present a different MAC address to the switch than the actual hardware MAC. This can be done for various reasons, such as bypassing MAC filters, masquerading as a legitimate device, or evading information gathering by masquerading as a different device.

VLAN Hopping This attack — accomplished via a handful of methods — allows the attacker to view or transmit to or from VLANs that would normally not be permitted. Since VLANs are often used for isolation, this may allow an attacker to view or communicate with sensitive machines.

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning While technically a Layer 3 attack, mitigation is often the responsibility of switches on the network. This attack allows an attacker to falsify ARP tables by sending forged packets, which causes clients to forward packets to the wrong MAC address for a specified IP address. This can be used to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) traffic bound for a specific host — including a gateway router — to observe traffic.

Mitigations ########### 

These attacks can be mitigated in various ways, some of which are covered in later lessons. A general overview of the mitigations for each of these follows:
MAC Flooding/Spoofing Mitigations for these attacks depend on the network configuration. If MAC addresses are known, each port can be configured with a whitelist of each address allowed on that port. Alternately, authentication in some manner — such as AAA or 802.1x — can be used to ensure that only approved devices are allowed to connect to ports or wireless for Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) switches

VLAN Hopping VLAN hopping can be mitigated via appropriate port configurations. Enforcing correct settings here involves ensuring that client ports are set to access only, disabling trunk auto-negotiation on client ports, and ensuring that the native VLAN for client ports is set to an inaccessible VLAN. More details about these attacks and their mitigations are covered in the VLAN Attacks and Defenses lesson.

ARP Poisoning ARP Poisoning attacks can be mitigated in several ways, depending on the network and its configuration. Mitigating these attacks generally involves switch and/or router configuration. Wi-Fi-based mitigation can be accomplished via client isolation, which prevents Wi-Fi clients from sending ARP packets to each other; wired-based mitigation can involve rate-limiting, manually binding important IP addresses to specific ports, or using vendor-specific, anti-spoofing technology that validates ARP packets by validating against known hosts and blackholing unknown hosts that attempt to duplicate IP addresses. More details about these attacks and their mitigations are given in the MitM Attacks and Defenses lesson.



The original STP is from IEEE's 802.1D standards and supports ensuring a loop-free topology for one VLAN. Therefore, this topic is vital to understand as a foundation for learning how the other STP iterations operate.

802.1D Port States

In the 802.1D STP protocol, ports transition through the following states:

Disabled: The port is in an administratively disabled configuration (shut down).

 Blocking: The state right after the switch port is enabled. The port does not forward any traffic, which ensures that no loop is created. The switch in this state does not modify the MAC address table, and it only receives BPDUs from other switches.

 Listening: The switch port has transitioned out of the blocking state and sends/receives BPDUs. At this point, it cannot transmit any other network traffic. The duration of the listening state correlates to the STP forwarding time. 

 Learning:  While the switch port is in this state, the switch can modify the MAC address table with traffic that it receives. The switch port — up to this point — only forwards BPDUs. The duration of the learning state correlates to the STP forwarding time.

Forwarding: The switch can update the MAC address table, and the switch port can forward all network traffic. During normal operations, the switch port stays in the forwarding state. 

 Broken: The switch has detected a problem on a port that can have a significant impact. The port drops packets as long as the situation persists.

Spanning Tree Port Types


The 802.1D STP standard defines three port types:
Root Port (RP): Each VLAN should only have one associated RP on a switch. The RP is a switch port that connects directly to the root bridge or an upstream switch in the spanning-tree topology. Designated Port (DP): There should be only one active designated port on a link. A DP is a switch port that receives and forwards BPDU frames to other switches and connects to downstream devices and other switches. Blocking port: A port that is not forwarding traffic because of STP calculations.


STP Key Terminology


There are several key terms related to the STP:
Root bridge: Most critical switch in the Layer 2 topology. All switch ports are in a forwarding state. Therefore, the Root Bridge is considered the top of the spanning tree for all path calculations by other switches. BPDU: A BPDU default destination MAC address is the multicast address 01:80:c2:00:00:00. They are used by switches to build and notify of changes in the STP topology. Two types of BPDUs exist:Configuration BPDUs: Used to identify the root bridge, root ports, designated ports, and blocking ports. The configuration BPDU contains the following fields: root path cost, root bridge identifier, local bridge identifier, max-age, hello time, forward delay, and STP type.Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU: Used to notify other switches of the Layer 2 topology changes.
Root Path Cost: Combined cost of a specific path to the root switch.System priority: A 4-bit value with a default value of 32,768. Determines the priority for a switch to be the root bridge.System ID extension: A 12-bit value indicating the VLAN that a BPDU belongs to. The system priority and ID extension combine to form the switch's root bridge identification.Root bridge identifier: Combination of the root bridge system MAC address, system ID extension, and system priority. Represented as system priority value added to the system ID extension value and resulting value concatenated with the root bridge system MAC address.Local bridge identifier: Combination of the local switch's bridge system MAC address, system ID extension, and system priority. Represented as system priority value added to the system ID extension value and resulting value concatenated with the root bridge system MAC address.Max-age: With a default value of 20 seconds, this is the time threshold before a bridge port saves its BPDU information. If a switch loses contact with the switch that originated the BPDU, the BPDU is still valid until the Max-Age timer expires.Hello time: Interval in which a BPDU is transmitted out of a port. The Hello Time default value is two seconds, though the value can be configured anywhere between 1–10 seconds.Forward delay: Interval a port stays in the listening and learning states. The Forward delay default value is 15 seconds, though this value can be configured to a value between 4–30 seconds.
NOTE: STP was developed before modern switches existed. Ethernet bridges were the early adopters of the STP. Switches today perform the same role as bridges at a much higher speed and scale. The terms bridge and switch are interchangeable in this lesson.


A TAP — sometimes called a Test Access Point 

In-band TAP

Setting up in-band — or inline — ensures no traffic is lost when dealing with a switch/router that has a larger traffic throughput. The network TAP is placed in line with the communication chain of the network (e.g., a device placed between two devices such that the original physical connection between the two devices is interrupted by the TAP, 

Out-of-band TAP

Operating out-of-band, the TAP/stack operates on its own network, receiving the mission network's traffic via one or more Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) ports from devices on the network. A downside to running out-of-band, however, is that SPAN ports can become overwhelmed in some circumstances.

 Link-State protocols send information about directly connected links to all routers in the network and updates consist of only those links that have changed.

 RFC 2328, OSPF is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used to distribute routing information in a single Autonomous System (AS). 

OSPF uses the shortest path first algorithm to build and calculate the optimal path to all known destinations. The optimal path is calculated with the use of the Dijkstra algorithm. These next steps are a simplified way of looking at the algorithm's operation:

1. On startup or when there is any change in routing information, a router generates a link-state advertisement. This advertisement represents the combination of all link-states on that router.

2. All routers exchange link-states by flooding link-states to all neighboring routers. Each router that receives a link-state update stores a copy in its link-state database and then advertises the update to other neighboring routers.

3. After each router completes building its database, the router calculates a Shortest Path Tree to all learned destinations. The router uses the Dijkstra algorithm to build the IP routing table, also referred to as the Routing Information Base (RIB).

4. If no changes in the OSPF network occur, such as the cost of a link or a network being added or deleted, OSPF only exchanges Hello packets. Any changes that occur are advertised through link-state packets, and the Dijkstra algorithm is recalculated to find the shortest path.

The algorithm places each router at the root of a tree and calculates the shortest path to each destination based on the cumulative cost required to reach that destination. Thus, each router has its own topology view even though all the routers build their shortest path tree using the same link-state database. The following sections cover the steps involved in building a shortest path tree.


This exact process is repeated to elect the BDR. Suppose there is a tie, the router with the highest router-ID wins. The default priority for an OSPF interface is one.

The adjacency building starts after multiple phases have been completed. Routers that become adjacent have the same LSDB. The following is a summary of the states an interface passes through before becoming adjacent to another router:

Down: No information has been received from a router on the network segment.
Attempt: On non-broadcast multi-access clouds such as X.25 and Frame Relay, the Attempt state indicates that no recent information has been received from a neighbor. An effort should be made to contact the neighbor by sending Hello packets at the reduced rate Poll Interval.
Init: The interface has detected a Hello packet coming from a neighbor, but bi-directional communication has yet to be established.
Two-way: Bi-directional communication has been established with a neighbor. The router has seen its router-ID in the Hello packets received from a neighbor. At the end of this stage, the election of a DR and BDR would have completed. Once the Two-way stage is completed, routers decide whether to proceed in establishing adjacency or not. This decision is based on whether one of the routers is a DR or BDR; or if the link is a virtual link or point-to-point.
Exstart: OSPF routers are trying to establish the initial sequence number that is used in the information exchange packets. This sequence number ensures that routers always receive the most up-to-date information. One router becomes the primary, the other secondary. The primary router proceeds to poll the secondary for information.
Exchange: OSPF routers report their entire link-state database by sending database description packets to all interfaces referenced in the OSPF network command. At this state, packets can be flooded to other interfaces on the router.
Loading: At this state, routers are completing information exchange. OSPF routers have built a link-state retransmission list and a link-state request list. Any incomplete or outdated information is added to the request list. Transmitted updates are added to the retransmission list until they get acknowledged.
Full: At this state, adjacency is complete. Neighboring routers are fully adjacent. Therefore, adjacent routers operate with a similar link-state database.
