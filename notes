Introduction to Switching ###############
Switches operate at Layer 2 of the OSI model,

Traversal between networks is handled on Layer 3 of the OSI model,

Layer 2 of the OSI model — the Data Link layer — handles addressing ethernet frames to direct communication between hosts on the same Local Area Network (LAN). Ethernet frames include Layer 2 addressing with vendor-assigned unique source and destination addresses for segments. In addition, ethernet commonly uses MAC addresses for communication on a segment. Other Layer 2 protocols — such as Frame Relay — use a completely different method of Layer 2 addressing.

MAC addresses are unique 48-bit addresses, separated into six octets, and noted in hexadecimal format. The first three octets — known as the Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUI) 

Layer 2 Devices ##################
simplest Layer 2 device for ethernet networks that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other is the hub. These devices broadcast all received data frames to all ports, regardless of the intended recipient. While these simple devices may still be found in some older networks, their usage is discouraged due to issues that they present including:
- The broadcast behavior allows any connected device to view traffic bound for any other device on the hub.

- Due to the rebroadcast nature of this device, transmitted frames can often collide when two connected devices attempt to send at the same time — especially during high-traffic load — causing dropped frames or retransmissions.


HUBS: one brodcast domain and one collison domain


switches allow for connectivity between devices; however, unlike hubs, switches utilize logic to determine which ports to forward frames onto. Switching logic and MAC address tables are covered later in this lesson.

Basic switches exist that perform only the bare minimum of switching to ensure that collisions do not occur frequently and ensure basic addressing. These switches — sometimes referred to as unmanaged switches — can be found in small business and home networks and even see use in enterprise networks. However, managed switches are typically utilized in enterprise networks, especially for central connectivity within the network. These switches are able to be configured and support more features — such as the ability to mirror ports, create VLANs to segregate networks, etc.

Cisco Devices ###################

Cisco devices tend to have several different methods for an administrator to connect to them. The most common methods follow:
 
- Direct connection to the console via the console or Auxiliary (AUX) port. This is generally a serial port connection and often requires the included Registered Jack (RJ)-45 to Recommended Standard (RS)-232 cable to connect to. The screen command or a terminal emulator can be used on Linux, while PuTTY or other terminal connection software is common on Windows.

- Connection to a virtual console, typically via Secure Shell (SSH) or Teletype Network (Telnet). Telnet is generally discouraged because its traffic is transmitted in plaintext. Binaries for SSH are available or commonly included on Linux systems and modern builds of Windows — though, PuTTY is still commonly used on Windows.

- Many modern Cisco devices also include web interfaces for viewing the status of and managing the device. These interfaces can be interacted with using standard browsers.


Cisco Security Model ############# 



Privilege level 0 is the lowest level privilege defined by default on Cisco devices. When connected with privilege level 0, the connected user only has access to these commands:
disable: Lower privilege level
enable: Raise privilege level
exit: Close the current session
help: Interact with the help system
logout: Close the current session


User
Privilege level 1. At this level — in addition to the above commands — some additional utilities are available for troubleshooting connectivity, such as the traceroute and ping commands. In addition, some configurations can be viewed via show commands. No configuration changes can be made at this level.


Privileged
Privilege level 15 is the highest level defined by default on Cisco devices. At this privilege level, all commands are available, and the device can be configured.

Cisco Configuration Mode ###########
make changes to the current configuration of the device, the configure terminal command must be used. For this command to be used, the current privilege level must be 15 (Privileged). As the configuration is navigated, the prompt changes to indicate what is currently being configured:

This section covers the version of the device, as well as some services that are configured:

- version: Indicates the Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) version for this device
- service timestamps: Determines how timestamps for debug and log entries are displayed
- service password-encryption: Automatically encrypts passwords when a new password is saved; no variant of the command means this is disabled
- service compress-config: Configuration is compressed automatically by this service

hostname: Sets the hostname for this device; shown in the command-line by default, may also be discovered by this name, or respond with this name during network discovery
aaa new-model: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA); disabled, this device does not support AAA features, such as user accounts, user levels, or command-level logging as handled by the AAA feature
spanning-tree mode: Determines the method used for Spanning Tree Protocol (STP
vlan internal allocation policy: Specific VLANs reserved for internal use — determines where these VLANs begin enumerating (ascending starts at VLAN Identifier [ID] 1006 and up, descending at 4095 and below)
interface: GigabitEthernet1/3 here indicates that this device is detected as a gigabit ethernet interface (as opposed to FastEthernet for 100 megabit ethernet) in slot zero, port zero; each internal slot may or may not contain multiple ports, depending on the interface card
media-type: RJ-45, Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP), or Auto
shutdown: Port is administratively disabled, ensuring that the port is not usable
line vty: Five (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) virtual terminals (used for SSH or Telnet) are enabled. Unlike con and AUX ports, these are not physical.


VLANs are defined in the IEEE 802.1Q standard, which states that 32 bits are allocated in the ethernet packet header for the following fields:
Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID): 16-bit field set to 0x8100 to identify the 802.1Q packetPriority Code Point (PCP): 3-bit Class of Service (CoS) field; assigned to Layer 2 QoS between switchesDrop Eligible Indicator (DEI): 1-bit field indicating whether the packet can be dropped when insufficient bandwidth is available on a link; when identified, indicates the potential use of Voice over IP (VoIP) trafficVLAN ID: 12-bit field specifying the VLAN associated with a network packet
